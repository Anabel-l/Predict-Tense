# Predict-Tense
- train a RNN to predict the phonemized past tense of English words
- using the letter sequences of 80% of the phonemized present & past tense, trains an RNN
- then using the remaining 20% tests the accuracy...
- accuracy currently low (around 50%) butttt when it was for the orthographic past tense only, the accuracy was around 95%
- accuracy is the main issue
